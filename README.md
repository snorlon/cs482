# cs482

This is a project from CS482 from fall 2015 semester.

In this project, I used over 8,000 Pokemon card images and fed them into a convolutional neural network to attempt to "learn" them enough to classify new cards properly.
The primary focus of this was to predict a pokemon cards type.

In this project, I used iPython notebooks and the cards were downloaded from lackeyCCG. The card images are not included as there are too many and they take up a lot of space.
